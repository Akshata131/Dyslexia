However, traditional methods of dyslexia identification, such as assessments by educational psychologists or neuropsychologists, can be time-consuming, expensive, and may require a child to miss significant amounts of school. Machine learning has the potential to provide a more efficient and accurate method for dyslexia identification. By analyzing data and identifying patterns in a child's performance on reading and language tasks, we’ll give them activities so that they can improve with this .The purpose of a dyslexia app using machine learning is to provide a tool for students with dyslexia to improve their reading and language skills in a personalized and engaging way. The app could use machine learning algorithms to identify dyslexia based on each student's scores and discrimination and provide targeted activities and games to address their specific needs.
